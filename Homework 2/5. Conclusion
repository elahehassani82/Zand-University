1. Which algorithm performed the best?
The performance of the algorithms can be evaluated based on the following metrics:

R² (Coefficient of Determination): Closer to 1 indicates better performance.
MAE (Mean Absolute Error) and MSE (Mean Squared Error): Lower values indicate better predictions.
Summary of Performance:

Linear Regression: Works well for linear relationships but may struggle with complex patterns.
Decision Tree: Handles non-linear relationships effectively but can overfit if not pruned.
Neural Network: Generally excels with complex, non-linear datasets but is resource-intensive.
The algorithm with the highest R² and lowest MAE/MSE is considered the best. Based on typical results:

Neural Networks often outperform others in predicting energy consumption due to their capacity to model non-linear relationships.
Decision Trees can also perform well if the data is structured with clear splits.

2. Which features influenced energy consumption the most?
Feature importance can be analyzed to determine which attributes had the greatest impact on energy prediction:

For Decision Trees: Feature importance can be extracted directly.
For Linear Regression: Coefficients provide insights into the contribution of each feature.
For Neural Networks: Advanced tools like SHAP or LIME can highlight feature contributions.
General Findings:

Features like X1 (Ratio of glazing area to total area) and X7 (Outside temperature) are typically highly influential.
Environmental conditions and equipment characteristics directly affect energy consumption.
